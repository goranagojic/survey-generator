# survey-generator

A project to generate surveys for subjective assessment of fundus segmentation masks.

## Survey types
At the moment it is possible to generate two types of surveys:
- Type 1 - select one among the diagnoses for a given segmentation mask, and
- Type 2 - rank given segmentation masks generated by different networks according to their diagnostic quality
